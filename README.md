# bureau-game-ios
Building an app for the silly yet funny game bureau game, where you and your colleagues are doing silly stuff and are rewarded with points for it. May the silliest win!

## What's this?
So this is an project of me, building an entire iOS app by my own. A colleague of mine suggested me this fun little game more or less officially called 'Bureau game'.
It's all about, who does more silly stuff in an serious office environment. For example you are supposed to signal your colleague that your current chat has ended by keeping your ears shut.
And we thought, why don't we build an app, so this could really be a thing in the sometimes boring office day. 
Normally you would do this with game with a partner who would keep an eye on you, so you really fulfill your fates, before you get rewarded with points.
Now it would be possible to do this with not only one but many partners and you would all compete against each other.

Let's see how this goes...
